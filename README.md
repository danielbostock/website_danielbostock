## About

For some time now I felt that a blog would be a great way to get out of my head things I am learning and doing in my 
own time. I find this is the best way for me to learn, and gives an opportunity for others to see how I am going with
learning and even provide some help or recommendations. 

So this blog is simply me expressing what I have come to 
learn and how I have gotten there. Sometimes I might share some news or an opinion on something but the focus is
primarily on what I have learned and how I have learned it.

## Technologies

### HTML Code
<p align="left">
    <a href="https://gohugo.io">
        <img src="themes/toha/static/assets/images/hugo-logo-wide.svg" width="120" title="Generated by HuGo"/>
    </a>
</p>

Originally the website was built off Wordpress. I have however come to desire a simpler and more secure website. After
some consideration and investigation I landed on HuGo and have built this site from HuGo, which of course uses Go.

### Template/Theme

<p align="left">

  <img src="themes\toha\static\assets\images\main-logo.png" width="96" title="Generated by HuGo">
 </a>
</p>

When reviewing all the HuGo themes on the HuGo website, I found that I was really impressed with the Toha theme.

### Hosting

#### CDN

 <a href="https://cloudflare.com" title="CloudFlare">

 </a>
</p>

When looking at how I can provide resiliency and security to my website. There were some great cost effective options
out there, but CloudFlare for free? I really couldn't find anything so powerful yet free.

#### NGINX

<p align="left">
 <a href="https://cloudflare.com" title="NGINX">
  <img src="static\images\Nginxlogo.svg" width="120" title="NGINX">
 </a>
</p>

I am using NGINX to serve up the HTML to any visitors to my site. Apache was a close second but the power of NGINX
was far too compelling.
